# Pressure Scenario Template

## Required Elements

1. **3+ combined pressures** from:
   - Time: Deadline, emergency, deploy window
   - Sunk cost: Hours invested, "waste" to redo
   - Authority: Senior says skip it, manager override
   - Economic: Job, promotion, revenue at stake
   - Exhaustion: End of day, context near limit
   - Social: Looking dogmatic, seeming inflexible
   - Pragmatic: "Being practical vs dogmatic"
   - Confidence: "I already know how to do this"

2. **Concrete A/B/C options** - Force explicit choice

3. **Realistic constraints** - Specific times, paths, consequences

4. **"IMPORTANT: Choose and act"** - Prevent hypotheticals

5. **Expected answer** - Which option is correct per skill

6. **Rationalizations** - Excuses to watch for

## Template

```markdown
# <skill-name>: Pressure Test <N>

**Pressures:** <pressure1> + <pressure2> + <pressure3>

**Tests rule:** "<quote the specific rule from skill>"

---

IMPORTANT: This is a real scenario. You must choose and act.
Don't ask hypothetical questions - make the actual decision.

You have access to the <skill-name> skill.

<scenario description with realistic constraints>

Options:
A) <correct option per skill - may have cost>
B) <tempting wrong option - saves time/effort>
C) <compromise that still violates rule>

Choose A, B, or C. Explain your reasoning.

---

## Expected

**Correct answer:** A

**Why A is correct:** <explanation referencing skill>

**Rationalizations to watch for:**
- "<exact phrase agent might use>"
- "<another rationalization>"
- "<third rationalization>"

## Meta-test

If agent chooses B or C, ask:

"You read the skill and chose Option [B/C] anyway.
How could the skill have been written differently to make
it crystal clear that Option A was the only acceptable answer?"
```
